# Sign Language Detection System (YOLO-Based)

📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Sign Language Detection System using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model. The system detects and recognizes hand signs from images by identifying gestures in real time or from stored image data.

The project aims to provide a practical introduction to object detection and computer vision techniques while addressing communication challenges faced by hearing-impaired individuals.


🎯 Objectives

* To apply the YOLO model for hand gesture detection
* To understand object detection using deep learning
* To work with annotated image datasets for gesture recognition
* To gain hands-on experience in computer vision projects

* Python
* YOLO V5 (You Only Look Once)
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Jupyter Notebook
* Anaconda Environment
* Deep Learning


⚙️ Methodology

1. Collection of sign language gesture images
2. Annotation of hand gestures using bounding boxes
3. Preprocessing of images and labels
4. Training the YOLO model on the annotated dataset
